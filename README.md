## Features 

* Navigation menu
+ My navigation menu has 3 different pages labeled Home, More and Sign-up. I have a underline to mark where on the website the user it at. 
+ My website is linear so that it's very easy to navigate through, the sections are clearly sepearted but not too far from each other, all my content is in a different color from the background so that it stands out. 
+ I have created a color and added a font that makes my content look sporty and that fits in to my product. 

* Header

+ I put multiple images with the header 'Fifa 22' so that the user clearly understands what this webpage is all about.  
 
+ The main header has a box with some Pre Order information, the pre order box tells the user that if you pre order you get exclusive content and then the price below is shown.
